### Project Overview
An Interactive HR Attrition board using Microsoft Excel. The general attrition rate of the company with 1470 employees is 16.1% (237 employees).
Filtered using Gender and Department which shows the attrition comes from a heavy number of male employees around
the ages of 26-35 and from the department of Research and Development followed closely by Sales. 
The reasons for the attrition shows low to average salaries, zero to low stock option level, 
low performance rating and quite a number of employees dissatisfied with their jobs.
### Data Source
The Primary dataset used for this analysis is a csv file from Kaggle [IBM HR ATTRITION](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
### Tools
- MS Excel 2019
   - Data Cleaning/Preparation
   - Data Transformation
   - Data Model
   - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset which helped in identifying the KPIs needed for this project
- Using Power Query to format and clean data like
   - Remove trims
   - Change datatypes
   - Replace Values
   - Add extra columns to show the range

### Data Analysis

### Findings/Insights
Generally, The Attrition Rate (16.1 %) is High
The insights from the analysis shows that the Male gender left the company  more than female gender.
The employees from the Department R&D followed closely by Sales left in high numbers.
This could be due to Low to Average Salaries, Poor Performance Rating, and zero to low stock option level. 
The Age group found to have left the most are 26-35 Years.

### Recommendations
- Salary Review 
- Apply measures to improve performance 
- Increase stock option level

### Limitations
 - The gender column was trimmed due to extra spaces
 - The datatypes were also corrected according to the data in the column
